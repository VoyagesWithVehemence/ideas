# Ideas for solving tools

- Anagrammer available via GSheet function that can handle long (>26 char) strings
  - Perhaps get around computational issues with some strong pre-canned assumptions/optimizations
- Grid parsing - crossword, acrostics
- Conceptual word association + regex
- Advanced code<->text processing (perhaps contribute to/rehost [CyberChef](https://github.com/gchq/CyberChef) rather than build something new)
  - e.g Things requiring OCR 
- Bulk google image search with webpage or PDF as input
- Automatic PDF/WebPage -> GSheet import including images
